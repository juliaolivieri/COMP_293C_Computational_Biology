# Homework 4 Problem 2 Instructions

In this problem we will try running BLAST on the cluster, and check how the number of results change when we change the seed length or the sequencing error of the reads.

## Setup

Start by logging into the cluster and navigating into the `COMP_293C_Computational_Biology` folder.

`$ cd COMP_293C_Computational_Biology`

Run `git pull` to download the files for today's assignment.

A folder called `homework4` should appear. Enter this folder.

`$ cd homework4`

You can use `ls` to check that this folder contains two `.sbatch` files, a python script called `gen_reads.py`, empty folders `job_output` and `outputs`,
